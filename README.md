# SimpleJavascript

By Marcus Barnes

This is a simple Javascript project that prompts the user to take a quiz by entering their responses to the question in the prompt window. When the user completes the quiz, their quiz results and my favorite songs playlist will be displayed in the html document.

This project includes the following:
  - Bootstrap Framework
  - Arrays
  - Array methods
  - Objects literals
  - Functions
  - For loops
  - While loops
  - if & else if statements
  - Basic concatenation
  - Basic DOM Manipulation
